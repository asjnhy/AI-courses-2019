Handwriting Number Classification (MNIST) Project 

MNIST dataset : (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)


With MNIST dataset, our mission is to distinguish handwriting numbers to 0-9 digits. 

1. Apply Binary Classifier for each of the digits then apply PCA analysis and Scaling. 
Then look for the optimal solution through GridSearch.
Mainly use Sklearn methods. 

2. Support Vector Machine with Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm.
Compared various situation such as (w/ or w/out) (scaling / PCA)
Visualize PCA analysis to see how image changes from original to OO% of Explained Variance. 

3. Apply Polynomial Features and Convolutional Feature Extraction with Sobel Filter as it showed the best performance out of other edge detecting filters.
Finally apply PCA for shorter computation time and use Gridsearch for best solution of all possible options.
